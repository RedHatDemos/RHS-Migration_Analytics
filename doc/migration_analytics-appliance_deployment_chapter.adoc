== Migration Analytics 0.1 beta - Appliance Deployment

:numbered:

== Introduction

To obtain a deploy a Red Hat CloudForms appliance, and make it run on VMware you may want to follow link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/5.0-beta/html/installing_red_hat_cloudforms_on_red_hat_virtualization/index[the official CloudForms documentation].

=== Add vSphere Provider

We will login in CloudForms using the appliance default credentials, being the user `admin` and using the default appliance password (*smartvm*).

image::add_vsphere_provider_01.png[Add vSphere provider to CloudForms]

. We click on *Add provider*. If the menu doesn't show up, we can go there by clicking on *Compute -> Infrastructure -> Providers*.
+
image::add_vsphere_provider_02.png[Add vSphere provider to CloudForms]

. We add all the data for the new infrastructure provider:
+
* Name: "vSphere"
* Type: "VMware vCenter"
* Hostname: "vcenter.example.com"
* Username: "administrator@vsphere.local"
* Password: ... the provided one
+
image::add_vsphere_provider_03.png[Add vSphere provider to CloudForms]

. Once we click on *validate* we can ensure that the credentials are OK and we can proceed to click the *Add* at the bottom of the page.
+
image::add_vsphere_provider_04.png[Add vSphere provider to CloudForms]

. We reach to the point where the *Insfrastructure Provider* has been added
+
image::add_vsphere_provider_05.png[Add vSphere provider to CloudForms]

. Now we shall add the credentials to access hosts. We go to *Compute -> Infrastructure -> Hosts*
+
image::add_vsphere_provider_06.png[Add vSphere provider to CloudForms]

. We select both hosts and click on *Configuration -> Edit Selected Items*
+
image::add_vsphere_provider_07.png[Add vSphere provider to CloudForms]

. Then we add the credentials being *Username* `root` and the provided password.
+
image::add_vsphere_provider_08.png[Add vSphere provider to CloudForms]

. We get the credentials saved successfuly

=== Configure SmartState Analysis
[WARNING]
Since the appliance was already previously configured for Smart State Analysis, the vddk library and associated tasks with it exist. The steps below are used when configuring a brand new appliance.

. Install the VMware VDDK onto the CFME appliance. (Instructions also available here https://www.tigeriq.co/sddk-on-vsphere-6/ ). First copy the *VMware-vix-disklib* from the `workstation` folder to `cf`:
+
----
[root@workstation-repl ~]# scp /root/Downloads/VMware-vix-disklib-stable.tar.gz cf:/root/
VMware-vix-disklib-stable.tar.gz              100%   19MB  86.0MB/s   00:00 
----

. SSH into `cf` and *untar* the file
+
----
[root@cf-REPL ~]# tar xzvf VMware-vix-disklib-stable.tar.gz
[Output removed]
----

. Create lib folder and copy content there:
+
----
[root@cf-REPL ~]# mkdir -p /usr/lib/vmware-vix-disklib
[root@cf-REPL ~]# cd vmware-vix-disklib-distrib
[root@cf-REPL vmware-vix-disklib-distrib]# cp -r bin64 /usr/lib/vmware-vix-disklib/
[root@cf-REPL vmware-vix-disklib-distrib]# cp -r lib64 /usr/lib/vmware-vix-disklib/
[root@cf-REPL vmware-vix-disklib-distrib]# cp -r include /usr/lib/vmware-vix-disklib/
----

. Create symbolic links to make them available and load them:
+
----
[root@cf-REPL ~]# ln -s /usr/lib/vmware-vix-disklib/lib64/libvixDiskLib.so /usr/lib/libvixDiskLib.so
[root@cf-REPL ~]# ln -s /usr/lib/vmware-vix-disklib/lib64/libvixDiskLib.so.6 /usr/lib/libvixDiskLib.so.6
[root@cf-REPL ~]# ldconfig
----

. Check they are added correctly
+
----
[root@cf-REPL ~]# ldconfig -p | grep vix
        libvixDiskLib.so.6 (libc6,x86-64) => /lib/libvixDiskLib.so.6
        libvixDiskLib.so (libc6,x86-64) => /lib/libvixDiskLib.so
----

. Now, we have to configure Smart State Analysis in CloudForms. We move to the UI in http://cf.example.com 

. We go to *Compute -> Infrastructure -> Hosts* and add ‘Default’ (root) credentials for each hypervisor, e.g.
+
image::cloudforms-configure_ssa-01.png[Configure Smart State Analysis 1]
+
image::cloudforms-configure_ssa-02.png[Configure Smart State Analysis 2]
+
When the host credentials are set correctly, a green ‘tick’ will appear in the bottom-right quadrant of the host’s tile icon.
+
[WARNING]
If it's not possible to add credentials for the ESXi hosts (or there are too many hosts with different credentials), VM scanning can still be performed using an authentication token provided by the vCenter. To configure this, set scan_via_host to be false in Configuration → Advanced settings:
+
----
:coresident_miqproxy:
  :scan_via_host: false
----

. Check that both the SmartProxy and SmartState Analysis workers are enabled (on) in *Configuration -> Settings -> Server*:
+
image::cloudforms-configure_ssa-03.png[Configure Smart State Analysis 3]

. In *Configuration -> Settings*, copy the ‘sample’ analysis profile:
+
image::cloudforms-configure_ssa-04.png[Configure Smart State Analysis 4]

. Call the new profile ‘default’ (it must be this name):
+
image::cloudforms-configure_ssa-05.png[Configure Smart State Analysis 5]

. Now go to the ‘File’ tab of the new analysis profile:
+
image::cloudforms-configure_ssa-06.png[Configure Smart State Analysis 6]
+
Add new entries for the files that should be collected for Migration Analytics. Collect Contents should be false by default but true for /etc/group and /etc/oraInst.loc:
+
----
C:/Program Files/Microsoft SQL Server/110
C:/Program Files/Microsoft SQL Server/120
C:/Program Files/Microsoft SQL Server/130
C:/Program Files/Microsoft SQL Server/140
C:/Program Files/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer
/etc/group
/etc/oraInst.loc

. Add the "VM SmartState Analysis profile” to the VMware provider:
+
image::cloudforms-configure_ssa-07.png[Configure Smart State Analysis 7]
+
image::cloudforms-configure_ssa-08.png[Configure Smart State Analysis 8]
+
[NOTE]
When a control policy has been successfully added to the provider a gold ‘shield’ icon will appear on the provider’s tile icon.

. Tag any VMs that shouldn’t be analyzed with the exclusions/do_not_analyze tag (Mainly Windows VMs running stateless applications such as Exchange server, possibly other databases). Snapshotting such VMs may cause data corruption.

. Optionally (for large environments)  increase the following values in Configuration -> Advanced settings to allow for more concurrent scans:
+
----
:coresident_miqproxy:
  :concurrent_per_ems: 1
  :concurrent_per_host: 1
----
+
. Optionally (for very large multi-1000 VM environments) increase the number of VM Analysis Collector workers, or add further appliances and set the SmartProxy Affinity to delegate scanning of certain Hosts & Datastores to specific CFME appliances. 

.. For a one-off scan, select one/several/all VMs in the Compute -> Infrastructure -> Virtual Machines page and click Configuration -> Perform SmartState Analysis

.. For a scheduled scan, add a “VM Analysis” schedule to Configuration -> Settings -> Schedules

. Monitor the status of the scans in the <Username> → Tasks page of the WebUI, and/or using the last_scan_on, last_scan_attempt_on and last_sync_on attributes on a VM object. Scanning can take up to 1 minute per VM. The "VM SmartState Analysis profile” should also tag VMs with operations/analysis_failed or operations/analysis_success as appropriate. 
+
When an SSA of a VM has completed successfully, the VM details page will have more information, i.e.
+
image::cloudforms-configure_ssa-09.png[Configure Smart State Analysis 9]

=== Enable Migration Analytics Menu

. In the CloudForms UI, navigate to Settings using the ⚙️ icon in the upper-right

. Click the Advanced tab. Find the `prototype` section, and under `migration_analytics` in this section, change `enabled` from false to true
```diff
 :prototype:
   :migration_analytics:
-    :enabled: false
+    :enabled: true
```

. Click Save

. SSH in the Cloudforms VM
----
# ssh cloudforms.example.com
----

. Restart the service
----
# systemctl restart evmserverd.service
----

== Examining VMware environment with Migration Analytics

. Access CloudForms through it's URL http://cf.example.com and login using `admin` username and the provided password.

+
image::cloudforms_login.png[CloudForms Login]

. Go to *Compute -> Infrastructure -> Providers*
+
image::cloudforms_check_virtualization_provider_01.png[Check Virt Provider]

. Select *vSphere* and click on *Authentication -> Re-Check Authentication Status*. This will confirm that the credentials work with the current infra.
+
image::cloudforms_check_virtualization_provider_02.png[Check Virt Provider]

. While the check is being performed, go to *Configuration -> Refresh Relationships and Power States* to get a fresh status of the running VMs
+
image::cloudforms_check_virtualization_provider_03.png[Check Virt Provider]
+
image::cloudforms_check_virtualization_provider_04.png[Check Virt Provider]

. Now that the infrastructure is completely refreshed, we will extract data from it. Go to menu *Migration -> Migration Analytics*. 
+
image::migration_analytics_examination_01.png[Migration Analytics Examination]

. Click on *Get started* button
+
image::migration_analytics_examination_02.png[Migration Analytics Examination]

. After the plugin has checked providers you will be taken to a summary page with all available providers. If you click on *vSphere* you will see a summary data of that provider. 
+
image::migration_analytics_examination_03.png[Migration Analytics Examination]

. Now let's click on *Collect inventory data*
+
image::migration_analytics_examination_04.png[Migration Analytics Examination]
+
image::migration_analytics_examination_05.png[Migration Analytics Examination]

. Select Provider *vSphere*
+
image::migration_analytics_examination_06.png[Migration Analytics Examination]

. Select *Detailed data*, as the current appliance is configured to run Smart State Analysis. Click *Continue*
+
image::migration_analytics_examination_07.png[Migration Analytics Examination]

. Inventory collection will be complete. A file has been delivered in the filesystem of `cf.example.com`, in this case is the file `/tmp/cfme_inventory-20190829-2305-mvl6xy.tar.gz`. We will copy it manually. We may *return to summary*

To copy the file to you local machine we first must copy it to your laptop or local machine:

----
$ scp root@192.168.0.100:/tmp/cfme_inventory-20190904-2341-1h3vafb.tar.gz .
----

image::migration_analytics_examination_08.png[Migration Analytics Examination]

Now we can review the data, and upload them to the Migration Analytics application in cloud.redhat.com following the link:migration_analytics-user_guide.adoc[Migration Analytics User Guide]
