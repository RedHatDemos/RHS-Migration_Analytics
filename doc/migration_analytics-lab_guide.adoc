== Migration Analytics 0.1 beta - Lab Guide

:numbered:

== Introduction

This Lab is built to help better understand the status of a running environment in order to assess, plan and execute a migration from a proprietary environment to an open source one. In order to do so, there are two tools built to help obtain and process data, initially focused on the Virtualization layer, but working to introspect the Operating System as well as the Applications. 
[NOTE] 
If you are interested in migrating applications, please check the link:https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhamt/overview[Red Hat Application Migration Toolkit]

The Lab Environment uses, to obtain data, the *Workload Examination Toolkit* (a.k.a. WET) which is a Migration Analytics plugin within Red Hat CloudForms. This toolkit help obtain the data, and download it as a single file to it can be reviewed, and then uploaded to be analyzed.

In order to analyze data, we will use the *Workload Analysis Tool* (a.k.a. WAT), which is an application running as SaaS on cloud.redhat.com. This tool will help us obtain the following reports to better understand the cost, risk and effort required to perform the migration:

* Initial Savings Estimation
* Workload Migration Summary
* Workload Migration Inventory

.Goal
* the goal of this lab is to obtain a set of data from a running environment, review it, upload it to be analyzed, and understand the benefits of the outcome provided in order to better assess and drive a migration.

== Overview

The environment to be used for this lab provides a running VMware vSphere environment with different workloads on it, and a deployed and configured Red Hat CloudForms instancei, with the Migration Analytics plugin configured to obtain data from it.

In this environment the following configuration steps are already done:

* Enabled Migration Analytics plugin in CloudForms
* Added the `vSphere` virtualization provider in CloudForms
* Provide credentials for virtualization providers and hosts in CloudForms
* Configured Smart State Analysis in CloudForms
* Configured Ansible, an ansible hosts file, in `workstation` andi, exchanged ssh keys (`/root/.ssh/id_rsa`) with all running machines.

The password to access all services is available link:https://mojo.redhat.com/docs/DOC-1174612-accessing-red-hat-solutions-lab-in-rhpds[here]

== Environment

A full new migration environment is deployed on every request. To make the environment unique a 4 character identifier is assigned to it (i.e. `1e37`), this identifier is referred in this documentation as *YOUR-GUID*.  

The migration environment consists of the following systems:

* An external service is configured as https://app-<YOUR-GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com pointing to the Load Balancer to make the Ticket Monster app accessible.

== Getting Started

. Once the system is running, use SSH to access your demo server using your OPENTLC login name and private SSH key.

* Using a Unix/Linux system:
+
----
$ ssh -i /path/to/private_key <YOUR-OpenTLC-USERNAME-redhat.com>@workstation-<YOUR-GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com
----

* Example for user 'batman' and GUID '1e37', using the default ssh private key:
+
----
$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa batman-redhat.com@workstation-1e37.rhpds.opentlc.com
----

. Become `root` using the provided password:
+
----
$ sudo -i
----

. Check the status of the whole environment, from the `workstation`, using ansible:
+
----
# ansible all -m ping
----
+
This command establishes a connection to all the machines in the environment (except ESXi servers). 
In case the machines are up an running a success message, per each, will show up. 
This is an example of a success message for the VM `cf.example.com`:
+
----
cf.example.com | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false, 
    "ping": "pong"
}
----
+ 
To check the infrastructure machines the following command can be also used:
+
----
# ansible infra -m ping
----
There are 4 VMs in the vCenter environment hosting an app with JBoss Core Services' Apache HTTP + modcluster as loadbalancer, two JBoss EAP 7 in domain mode, and a Postgresql database.
To check only if these ones are running, you may use the following command:
+
----
# ansible app -m ping
----
+ 
[NOTE]
As this environment is quite big, and it is generated and powered up for you in a cloud environment, some resources may suffer from issues or delays depending on the status of the cloud. You may need to manually start up or reboot some of them. Please review everything is running before proceeding forward.

. Establish an SSH connection to the CloudForms server and monitor `automation.log`:
+
----
# ssh cf.example.com
# tail -f /var/www/miq/vmdb/log/automation.log
----
+
[TIP]
The log entries are very long, so it helps if you stretch this window as wide as possible.
+
[NOTE]
The log entries can be also seen in the CloudForms web UI in *Automation -> Automate -> Log*.

. Verify that the Ticket Monster app is running:

* Point your browser to https://app-<YOUR-GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com and check it is running:
+
image::app-ticketmonster-running.png[Ticket Monster app running]
[NOTE]
You must accept all of the self-signed SSL certificates.
+
image::ssl_cert_warning.png[SSL Cert Warning]
+
If the ticketmonster app is not running, you may run the following command in `workstation`:
+
----
# start_vms
----

. Prepare to manage the environment. From a web browser, open each of the URLs below in its own window or tab, using these credentials (except when noted):

* *Username*: `admin`
* *Password*: `<to_be_provided>`
+
[NOTE]
You must accept all of the self-signed SSL certificates.
