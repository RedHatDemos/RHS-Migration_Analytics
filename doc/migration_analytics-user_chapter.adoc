== Migration Analytics 0.1 beta - Using the Analysis Tool 

:numbered:

=== Analyzing the Data from Examination with the Workload Analysis Tool

Once we have the data we proceed to analyze it in our Software as a Service offering, the Workload Analysis Tool, which is part of cloud.redhat.com 

. We access https://cloud.redhat.com/beta (until it's available, we will use an internal sandbox environment, please ask for help in migrate@redhat.com if you want access). We select in *Migration Services*, the entry *Migraion Analytics*

. We select the payload file to be analyzed. We may want to use this link:https://github.com/RedHatDemos/RHS-Migration_Analytics/blob/master/payloads/cfme_inventory-20190912-demolab_withSSA.tar.gz?raw=true[sample file] that contains more hosts and VMs than the lab environment. We choose our *Report Name* and provide a *Report Description*. It is important ot include the growth rate expected, as well as the planned migration per year.
